                  Mathematics does not have to be a barrier for your academic success.

                  Our current education system has a strong emphasis on mathematics.
                  From standardized testing and AP courses to calculus prerequisites in college, having to excel in mathematics in order to pursue your academic dreams is essentially unavoidable.
                  I believe that I have the skills and experience to aid students in that process.

                  I graduated from Brown in 2019 with a B.A. in mathematics, and have recently obtained a M.S. in mathematics from City College with a 3.99 GPA.
                  I have 5 years of experience in education, including advanced math enrichment such as graph theory, number theory, and game theory. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in mathematics at the CUNY Graduate Center.
